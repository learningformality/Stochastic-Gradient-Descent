This file is a simple implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) on the SKlearn Breast Cancer dataset.
The format of this learning problem is binary classification using the logistic loss. SGD will minimize the logistic loss
to varying degrees across different size training sets. We compare the loss and error on each size of training set and
output a graph showing the differences. For a training set size of n=350 we get a bit over 90% accuracy on the dataset.
